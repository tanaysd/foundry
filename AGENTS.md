# üß† AGENTS.md ‚Äî Operating Manual for Codex and Other Automated Contributors

> _‚ÄúEvery agent is a teammate. Treat it like one: brief it, bound it, and review it.‚Äù_  
> ‚Äî Foundry Design Principle #07

This document defines how intelligent agents (e.g., Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, etc.) interact with this repository.  
It ensures every autonomous contribution ‚Äî code, documentation, or test ‚Äî follows the same standards as human collaborators.  
Agents act as builders, not overlords: they write, test, document, and close their own work under human oversight.

---
## Purpose
Establish a unified operating protocol for AI agents contributing to this repository.  
All contributions must meet the same bar for review, testing, and traceability as human work.  
The goal: reproducibility, composability, and accountability across all agent-driven development.

---
## Philosophy
- **Deterministic > clever** ‚Äî predictability and reproducibility first.  
- **Tests are contracts** ‚Äî every behavior must be verifiable.  
- **Local first** ‚Äî no hidden dependencies.  
- **Composable primitives** ‚Äî agents should build reusable modules.  
- **Traceability** ‚Äî every change links to a task card (`TC-###`) and its Issue.

---
## Task Intake Protocol
1. **Source of truth:**  
   Each task originates as a YAML task card in `.codex/tasks/` or as a GitHub Issue labeled `codex-task`.

2. **Required fields:**  
   `id`, `title`, `context`, `deliverables`, `test_plan`, `constraints`, `steps`, `acceptance_criteria`, `dependencies`, `auto_close`.

3. **Branch naming convention:**  
   ```
   codex/<task-id>-<slugified-title>
   # Example: codex/tc-003b-openai-generate-basic
   ```

4. **Pull Request policy:**  
   Every PR must include the line:
   ```
   Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>
   ```
   if `auto_close: true` is set in the task card.

5. **Commit format:**  
   ```
   [TC-XXX] <summary>
   ```
   Body: short rationale and relevant references.

## Code Generation Guidelines
**Language & Style**

- Python 3.11+, `src/` layout.  
- Type-safe (`mypy --strict`), linted (`ruff`), coverage ‚â• 85%.  
- Prefer functional purity; use classes only when necessary.  
- No live API calls unless explicitly whitelisted.

**Testing Rules**

| Type | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|
| Unit | `tests/<area>/` | Verify pure logic |
| Contract | `tests/contracts/` | Enforce cross-adapter invariants |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | Validate composed flows |
| CI Safety | `tests/ci/` | Metadata, automation, and infra validation |

Tests must be deterministic and self-contained.  
Fixtures and mocks are preferred over live dependencies.

**Documentation**

- Each module must include a Markdown file under `docs/`.  
- Every component must describe its *Design Intent*.  
- Use Mermaid diagrams where helpful; keep output Markdown-only.

---
## Pull Request Lifecycle
| Phase | Action | Responsible |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Intake | Parse linked Issue / task card | Codex |
| Implementation | Generate code, tests, and docs | Codex |
| Verification | Run `make lint`, `make type`, `make test` | Codex |
| PR Creation | Draft PR referencing Issue | Codex |
| Review | Validate, test, and discuss | Maintainer |
| Merge | ‚ÄúSquash & Merge‚Äù to `main` | Maintainer / Codex |
| Close | GitHub auto-closes via `Closes #<issue>` | GitHub |

**Rule:** No PR merges until all acceptance criteria in the task card are satisfied.

---
## Safety & Guardrails
Agents **must never**:

- Push directly to `main`.  
- Execute or import unverified code.  
- Remove existing tests without replacement.  
- Commit secrets or credentials.

**Guardrail scripts:**

- `scripts/ci/check_pr_closing_ref.py` ‚Äî ensures PRs link to Issues.  
- `scripts/ci/enforce_tests_exist.py` ‚Äî ensures all deliverables are tested.  
- `scripts/ci/check_metadata_sync.py` ‚Äî ensures `README` and `pyproject.toml` are aligned.

---
## Communication Protocol
Agents may post structured GitHub comments:

```
### üß© Codex Update
Task: TC-003B ‚Äî OpenAI adapter non-streaming generate()
Phase: Planning ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Review
Notes:
- Created branch codex/tc-003b-openai-generate-basic
- Generated deliverables:
  - src/foundry/core/adapters/openai.py
  - tests/adapters/test_openai_generate_basic.py
Next: Running tests locally.
```

Humans may reply with operational directives:

```
@codex please re-run with stricter mypy config
```

---
## Evaluation Loop
Each agent run is evaluated on:

| Metric | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Correctness** | Tests pass successfully |
| **Style Adherence** | Linting, typing, documentation |
| **Autonomy** | % of tasks completed without intervention |
| **Reusability** | Composability of outputs |
| **Safety** | No policy or security violations |

All results are logged in `reports/agent_runs.json`.

---
## Extending the Foundry Agent Ecosystem
Agents integrated with this repository must register in `agents/registry.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: codex
  role: builder
  capabilities: [codegen, tests, docs, pr-automation]
  entrypoint: .codex/
- id: claude
  role: reviewer
  capabilities: [code-review, test-summarization]
- id: gemini
  role: researcher
  capabilities: [docs-refinement, experiment-tracking]
```

Agents must describe their roles and capabilities when updating the registry.

---
## Golden Rules
1. Every change maps to a task card.  
2. Every deliverable has a test.  
3. Every PR auto-closes its Issue.  
4. Every merge leaves `main` buildable and type-checked.  

---
## Quick Reference
| Command | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `make setup` | Initialize environment |
| `make lint` | Run linter |
| `make type` | Run strict type checks |
| `make test` | Execute tests |
| `make docs` | Serve documentation |
| `make ci` | Full local CI pipeline |
| `make report` | Summarize agent metrics |

Submitting contributions implies agreement to the Contributor License Agreement in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Closing Note
> **Foundry** is not just a toolkit *for* agents ‚Äî it‚Äôs a foundry *run by* agents.  
> Treat this file as your operational contract: every improvement, by Codex or by humans, strengthens the system.
