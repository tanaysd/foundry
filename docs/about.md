# About Foundry

Foundry provides the building blocks for high-assurance agent development: schemas that define the lingua franca between agents; adapters that connect to major model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google); a safety and evaluation layer for validating reasoning traces; and a documentation scaffold for iterative experimentation. Every component is type-safe, testable, and built for composability. Foundry is the foundation for creating vertical and general purpose agents in a local, reproducible environment.

## Why Foundry

- **Local-first experimentation.** Develop agents locally with deterministic tooling before promoting to production environments.
- **Composable architecture.** Mix and match adapters, schemas, and evaluators to assemble bespoke agent workflows.
- **Safety by default.** Built-in evaluation harnesses help uncover regressions in reasoning quality and guardrails.
- **Documentation scaffolding.** Streamline onboarding with generated reference material and worked examples.
