    "Foundry is a modular, local-first framework for developing and evaluating agentic systems. "

LONG_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Foundry provides the building blocks for high-assurance agent development: schemas that "

    "(OpenAI, Anthropic, Google); a safety and evaluation layer for validating reasoning "
    "traces; and a documentation scaffold for iterative experimentation. Every component is "
    "type-safe, testable, and built for composability. Foundry is the foundation for creating "
    "vertical and general purpose agents in a local, reproducible environment."
